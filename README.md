# Code for Hope
Code for Hope is a self-initiated service-learning project teaching underprivileged students Python fundamentals. By teaching the highly relevant and sought-after skill of programming, Code for Hope aims to create a fair playing field independent of socio-economic status for all to ultimately close the income gap. As the Founder and Chairperson, I worked closely with the managers of our partner organisations and created the syllabus, learning materials, and online IDE for the students and teacher volunteers. In its pioneering 2021-2022 run, Code for Hope taught 200 students, collaborated with 14 organisations, and recruited 25 volunteers.
