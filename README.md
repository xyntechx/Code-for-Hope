# Code for Hope
Code for Hope is a self-initiated service-learning project created by me and two other schoolmates. We initiated this project to teach underprivileged students Python fundamentals as programming is a highly relevant and sought-after skill in today's digital era. In doing so, we hoped to create a fair playing field independent of socio-economic status for all, driven by the ultimate aim of alleviating income inequality. In its pioneering 2021-2022 run, Code for Hope taught 200 students, collaborated with 14 CDAC centres, and recruited 25 volunteers.
