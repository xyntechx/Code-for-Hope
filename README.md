# Code for Hope
Code for Hope is a service-learning group consisting of JC1 students from Raffles Institution passionate about teaching programming to underprivileged students. This is because we believe in the relevance of programming in today‚Äôs digital world as well as ensuring a fair playing field independent of socio-economic status for all students. So far, we have collaborated with 5 CDAC centres and taught 60 students in Singapore!
